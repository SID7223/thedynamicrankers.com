    This file previously existed ONLY for Netlify form detection.
    Netlify has been removed and forms are now handled via
    Vercel serverless API (/api/contact).

    This file is no longer required and can be safely deleted
    if nothing in the app links to it.

  <p>
    This page previously contained a Netlify-only hidden form.
    It has been removed for Vercel deployment.
